# Dental intervention detection via Faster RCNN and ResNet50

Goal: Train a robust dental intervention detection model. <br>
Challenges: 
 - imbalanced classes, 
 - inconsistent bounding box labeling methodology, 
 - many unlabelled instances

The trained model was used to improve the original dataset through a semi-automatic process where a dentist could approve or reject high-confidence predictions that did not match the ground truth.
